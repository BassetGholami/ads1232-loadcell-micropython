# ADS1232 + 100kg Load Cell (MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico W)

MicroPython project for reading a **100kg load cell** using the **ADS1232 24-bit ADC** and a **Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040)**.
It includes a simple 2-point calibration (empty + known weight) and continuously prints the weight in **kg**.

## Hardware
- MCU: Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040, **3.3V logic**)
- ADC: ADS1232 (powered at **5V** in this setup)
- Load cell: 100 kg strain gauge load cell (4-wire)

## Important (5V ADS1232 vs 3.3V Pico W)
The Pico W uses **3.3V logic**. If your ADS1232 board drives digital lines at **5V** (especially `DOUT`), you may need:
- a **logic level shifter**, or
- another protection/interface circuit

Always use a **common GND** between the Pico W and the ADS1232 board.

## Wiring

### 1) Load Cell → ADS1232 (Analog)
This setup uses the following terminals on the ADS1232 board:

| ADS1232 Terminal | Load Cell Wire Color | Description |
|---|---|---|
| E+ | Red   | Excitation + (bridge supply +) |
| E- | Black | Excitation - (bridge supply -) |
| A+ | Green | Signal + |
| A- | White | Signal - |

> Note: Wire colors are common but not universal. If your readings are inverted or unstable, double-check your load cell datasheet and wiring.

### 2) ADS1232 → Raspberry Pi Pico W (Digital)
GPIO mapping used in `firmware/main.py`:

| ADS1232 Signal | Pico W GPIO | Direction |
|---|---:|---|
| PDWN | GP22 | Output |
| DOUT | GP20 | Input |
| SCLK | GP21 | Output |
| GND  | GND  | - |

## Firmware
- Language: MicroPython
- Main file: `firmware/main.py`

### Calibration
On first run, the firmware:
1. Measures offset with an empty load cell
2. Asks you to place a known weight (**default 5000 g**)
3. Saves calibration values to `cal.txt` on the device filesystem

To recalibrate:
- delete `cal.txt` from the Pico filesystem
- reboot / run again

## How to run
1. Flash MicroPython to the Pico W
2. Copy `firmware/main.py` to the board as `main.py`
3. Open the serial REPL to see prompts and readings

## Output
Prints the weight in kg every 0.5 seconds.
